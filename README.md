# music-metadata-browser

### Development of this package is discontinued

After more than 6 years, 66 releases, this life `music-metadata-browser` will end.
This package was designed as wrapper around [music-metadata](https://github.com/Borewit/music-metadata), 
to enable [music-metadata](https://github.com/Borewit/music-metadata) usage in the browser. 
That ambition is still alive and kicking, which is now replaced by the hybrid support [music-metadata](https://github.com/Borewit/music-metadata) is offering out if the box.

[music-metadata](https://github.com/Borewit/music-metadata) can now directly be used by a _module bundler_, like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), 
and does no longer depend on Node.js specific APIs.
